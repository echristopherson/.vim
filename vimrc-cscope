" Cscope settings
"

" See ~/.vim/plugin/cscope_maps.vim, which I downloaded at some point and have
" modified a little.
" Key mappings defined in that file use <C-\>, <C-@>, or <C-@><C-@> as
" leaders; these mean use current window, split horizontally, and split
" vertically, respectively. This is followed by one of these keys (note that
" these are the same as the first argument to the `:cscope find` command):
"
" s: Find this C symbol
" g: Find this definition
" d: Find functions called by this function
" c: Find functions calling this function
" t: Find this text string
" e: Find this egrep pattern
" f: Find this file
" i: Find files #including this file
